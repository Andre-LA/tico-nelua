# tico-nelua

[Tinycoffe](https://github.com/canoi12/tinycoffee) binding for [Nelua](https://nelua.io/)

This project uses [nelua-decl](https://github.com/edubart/nelua-decl) to generate the basic bindings, which the output is processed to add better integration between the language and the library.
